<h2>How not to use this</h2>
If you don't want to use this system to assign students to groups, you can just
pick a URL of the form
<a href="/overview/PickNameHere/10/">https://bingley.physics.oregonstate.edu/overview/PickNameHere/10/</a>
where the number at the end is the number of boards that you want to display on the overview.

<h2>How to use this</h2>
To assign students to groups randomly, you will need to upload a CSV-formatted file representing your
class roster.  To get started, download <a href="example.csv">this example CSV file</a>.  You can now
select this file with the button above to generate a set of "student" groups for a faculty meeting.  You
can edit this file with any spreadsheet.  I'll quote some small snippets here, as I discuss the fields.

<p>
  <strong>Metadata</strong>
  The first two lines:
  <pre>
title,Example class,,,,,,
minimum,3,,,,,,</pre>
  just give a title to the class (Faculty Meeting in this case), and specify the minimum number of
  students per group.  I think 3 is probably a good number here.  The code will actually aim to
  create as many groups as possible that are one over the minimum so as to reduce the total number
  of breakout rooms.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Names and emails</strong>
  The rest of the file most fundamentally consists of student-visible names followed by email addresses.
  <pre>
Heidi,schellmh@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,
Henri,jansenh@oregonstate.edu,,,,,,</pre>
  The name here is whatever you want to be visible to students.  I ask students what they like to go by,
  and that is what I'll put here, with initials to disambiguate students with the same name.  The email
  addresses here must be what zoom expects, which I believe is ONID emails, in order for the preassigned
  rooms to function properly.  Note also that these emails are <strong>only</strong> used for the zoom
  preassigned rooms.
  These lines can contain a few extra possible pieces of information, which I'll discuss below.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Absent students</strong>
  <pre>
Emily,vanzeee@oregonstate.edu,absent,,,,,</pre>
  If you put the word "absent" in the third column, the student will be interpreted as unlikely to show
  up.  They will be assigned to a group, but won't count towards the minimum number of students in their
  group.  If you want the student omitted entirely, just don't put them in your file.
</p>
<p>
  Putting "absent" students into groups like this has two advantages.  Firstly, if the student does indeed
  end up showing up, they will have a group.  Secondly, if you share the groups with the class on Canvas,
  you will not be publishing to the class which students are going to be absent.  I intend to mark as "absent"
  students who are frequently absent, to reduce the chance that any groups will be too small.  The "absent"
  students are evenly distributed across all groups, with each group guaranteed a minimum number of students
  who are not marked as absent.  I will also ask students to inform me if they expect to be absent on any
  given day.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Teaching team</strong>
  <pre>
David,roundyd@oregonstate.edu,instructor,,,,,</pre>
  If you put the word "instructor" in the third column, the person will not be
  assigne to a student group, but instead to a "teaching team" zoom room.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Preferred partners</strong>
  <pre>
David R,roundyd@oregonstate.edu,,-Mean Person,+David C,,,
Liz,giree@oregonstate.edu,+Heidi,+Corinne,+David R,+Ethan,+David C,+Janet</pre>
  Each line ends with any number of names preceded by either <samp>+</samp> or  <samp>-</samp>
  The name must precisely match one of the users' assigned names.  If it is preceded by a <samp>+</samp>,
  then the algorithm will prefer to place those students in the same group.    If it is preceded by a <samp>-</samp>,
  then the algorithm will <strong>try very hard</strong>> to avoid placing those students in the same group.
  <em>Currently it is still possible that the students will be placed in the same group, so if there is an
    abuse or safety concern, then you must always manually verify that the students have not been placed
    in the same group!
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  My plan is to create "Fridays with Friends," in which students are allowed a preference of partners in this
  way.  This will simulate the in-class pattern where students get to choose where they sit, and hopefully will
  help in alleviating pandemic-related loneliness and isolation.  I do not intend to allow student preference
  <em>always</em> because I have concerns both about less popular students who may feel rejected as well as having
  concerns that working with the same partners could result in some students being more passive in group work,
  if they always know that their partner will get the correct answer before they do.
</p>

<h3>After you upload the CSV</h3>
You will be presented a page with a few pieces of information.
<p>At the top there
will be a link to download the Zoom autoassignment CSV file.  You should do so immediately, as the server does
not store this information long-term, and discards it the next time a set of student groups are generated.
Downloading this file will also delete the information from the server.</p>
<p>
  The next bit of ephemeral information is HTML content displayed on the page indicating which students are
  assigned to which groups.  My intent is to copy this from my browser into a Canvas announcement.  This is
  FERPA-protected information, and therefore is not stored on the bingley server at all.  (Note that one
  reason to avoid full names is to reduce the scope of information leaked in case of error.)  I used a similar
  approach in PH 366 for student pairs, and it worked well.  This group listing also has links that each student
  can follow to get to their whiteboard.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, there is a link that you can share with your class (or just your instructional team) to a page that
  will show all the group whiteboards.  You may not wish to share this with your class, but the URLs are easy to
  guess, so you should not assume that students cannot find the other groups' whiteboards.
</p>

<h3>About the URLs</h3>
The URLs that are generated have a randomly chosen sequence of words that is designed to be easy to remember
but impossible to guess (see the <a href="https://m.xkcd.com/936/">relevant xkcd</a>).  These words are designed
to avoid profanity or other objectionable words, but it is still possible that you'll end up with something you
don't want to share with students.  If that happens, just upload again to get a new set of groups with a new
URL.

<h3>Longevity of whiteboards</h3>
The whiteboards will
remain accessible indefinitely.  This is intentional, so students can consult their work later while studying.
It also raises the potential for vandalism or otherwise harmful content.
If you observe a problem, I can delete a whiteboard manually.  I hope this will not be a big issue because we don't
reuse the whiteboards, so students will not be likely to see a vandalized whiteboard.
